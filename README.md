This was a project for the video games course in my senior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). The 58 pages report (Spanish) can be viewed [here](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Unity3DGame/blob/master/Report.pdf) for further explanations.

This is a 3D version of the 2D game implemented with PyGame, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Pygame2D)
We developed the history and background for the game and implemented different maps, each with their own enemies. 



## Terrain generator

The scenario is generated algorithmically, and we have two different locations:
- Desert, whose dunes are generated with the funtion: 
 f(x,y) = cos(rand(x,y))*cotax+sen(rand(x,y))*cotay
- Ice, whose glaziers are generated by a 4x4 matrix convoluting the coordinates.

## GUI
The following scenes where implemented to facilitate navigation between levels:
- startMenu
- pauseMenu
- gameOverMenu

## Agent logic:
The player's controller was imported from a functional asset, which allows to move, jump, etc.
The health system is general for enemies and the player, with the methods Awake() and TakeDamage(). PlayerHelath extends from that and adds the functionality that if the live is 0, then it is GameOver.
For the attack system, a prefab Weapon was designed and various prefab Shoot. Each Shoot has as attributes damage and speed, so that when it colides, it makes damage. 

## Enemies
There are range (robots) and melee (animals) enemies, each with their own logic.
