Unity 3D Game
============

This was a project for the video games course in my senior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). The 58 pages report (Spanish) can be viewed [here](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Unity3DGame/blob/master/Report.pdf) for further explanations.

This is a 3D version of the 2D game implemented with PyGame, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/DaniRuizPerez/Pygame2D)
We developed the history and background for the game and implemented different maps, each with their own enemies. 


## Terrain generator

The scenario is generated algorithmically, and we have two different locations:
- Desert, whose dunes are generated with the funtion: 
 f(x,y) = cos(rand(x,y))*cotax+sen(rand(x,y))*cotay
- Ice, whose glaziers are generated by a 4x4 matrix convoluting the coordinates.

## GUI



## How to play
